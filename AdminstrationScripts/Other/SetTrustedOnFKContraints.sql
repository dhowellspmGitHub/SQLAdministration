Repair Not Trusted FK Constraints

If you bulk insert data into a table with a foreign key constraint or with disable FK check, then this FK constraint will be marked as "not trusted".
This can cause performance issues, because the query optimizer may don't use a related index for this constraint.

This script selects all not trusted foreign key and generate a "repair" SQL Statement, which includes an error handling + logging with TRY/CATCH blocks for each statement.
Copy the query result into a new query window and execute it to repair the constraints

See MSDN ALTER TABLE (Transact-SQL) => option "WITH CHECK | WITH NOCHECK"
